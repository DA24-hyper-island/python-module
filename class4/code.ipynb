    "\n",
    "* Reusability: A function can be used over and over again. You do not have to write redundant code. For example, a sum() function could compute the sum of all the integers we provide it. We won’t have to write the summing operation ourselves each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplicity: Functions are easy to use and make the code readable. We only need to know the inputs and the purpose of the function without focusing on the inner workings. This abstraction allows us to focus more on gaining the output instead of figuring out how it was computed."
